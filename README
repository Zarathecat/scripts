Misc. convenience scripts. And config. Do not expect pretty code within. :)
They're odds and ends that I want to back up somewhere, and I've finally
got round to making my github acct usable again.

Scripts
-------

pyserv.py is a simple https server you can run from some directory.
It's (reluctantly) written in python3.
I use it to test godot web exports on other devices in my home network,
since audio won't work without SSL.
You'll have to generate your certs yourself; I used `mkcert localhost`.
Then add the paths manually.

compress.py converts all mp3s in some directory to a very low bitrate.
It outputs the files in the directory it's run from, so run it in a
different directory to the one with the input files to keep things organised.
You need lame installed. Useful for game sounds and that kind of thing.

Etherpad
--------

Etherpad service lives at /etc/systemd/system/etherpad.service
enable with `sudo systemctl enable etherpad.service`

get_etherpads.py gets all etherpads at some host and saves them to
text files in a directory. You need to have the etherpad admin info to
run it, since you need to be able to access the page that lists all pads.
Pad address and admin-list-page address must be saved to two files, because
this code was written with extreme laziness. Includes a painful timeout hack.
It's in python 2.7. Again, code here is pure trash. But it works.

And here's something you may need at some point:

Configs
-------

.vimrc has config to treat ctrl+z as `u` , and some nice linewrap stuff

.bashrc sets my history to max, and aliases my godot binary.


Installs
--------

Todo: get nice list of things I always use that don't come on distros
by default, so I can install them right away. git, vim...
