Installs
--------

Todo: get nice list of things I always use that don't come on distros
by default, so I can install them right away. git, vim...

Configs
-------

Todo: same, but settings.

Etherpad
--------

Etherpad service lives at /etc/systemd/system/etherpad.service
enable with `sudo systemctl enable etherpad.service`
